    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cold, refrigerated dough is the secret to making delicious focaccia! </p>
        <p>This 4-ingredient recipe requires only 5 minutes of hands-on time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups (512 g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons (10 g) kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons (8 g) instant yeast</li>
            <li>2 cups (455 g) lukewarm water</li>
            <li>butter for greasing</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and instant yeast.</li>
            <li>Add the water. Using a rubber spatula, mix until the liquid is absorbed and the ingredients form a sticky dough ball.</li>
            <li>Rub the surface of the dough lightly with olive oil. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel, cloth bowl cover, or plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Line a 9Ã—13-inch pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Pour a tablespoon of oil into the center of the pan. Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center.</li>
            <li>Place dough into the prepared pan. Roll the dough ball in the oil to coat it all over. Let the dough balls rest for 3 to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the underside is golden and crisp.</li>
        </ol>
