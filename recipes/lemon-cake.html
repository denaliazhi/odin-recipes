    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This cake is moist, fluffy, tangy, and so easy to make from scratch!</p>
        <p>Every bite is bursting with fresh lemon flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp lemon zest</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
            <li>0.5 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>0.5 cup buttermilk</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar together at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 4-6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla extract and lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Add about one-third of the flour mixture and mix until almost combined, then add half the buttermilk and mix until just combined. Repeat with another third of flour mixture and then the last half of the buttermilk, ending with the last third of the flour.</li>
            <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 45-55 minutes until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick comes out mostly clean.</li>
        </ol>
